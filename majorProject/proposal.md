# Major Project Proposal
 - For my final project in Computer Science 30, I will be creating a game that will be a 2D shooter that will be a
   wave game that will end once reached a certain wave. The Objective is to have as many points and finish the game
   
## Need to Have List
  - I need a movement and shooting type system
  - I need 2d collide to detect hitboxes for the bullets of the character
  - I need the enemy to have an ai that will move closer to the player
  - I need a Main Menu for my game that will show controls, character selection, and a play option
  - I need sound effects adding a sort of tranquility and intensness at times
  - I need a point systen that will be counted whenever you shoot and enemy and successfully kill it
  - I need a grid based layout so the character doesnt go passed the boundries
  
## Want to Have List
  - I want a shop system that will upgrade your gun if you buy them
  - I want an art style made by myself and have it designed by me
  - I want a character select screen that will choose a character screen with at least 2 characters
  - I want a wave system that once high enough the game will end you would've won (eg: Wave 30 is when the game ends)
  - I want an Easter Egg in the Main Menu that will change multiple things parts of the game (Characters, Sound effects, etc..)
  - I want multiple levels in the game creating a more hard and advanced route in the game
  - I want multiple gamemodes (eg: Story Mode, Multiplayer, Arcade etc...)
  - I want a millis type of system for a buy time
  - I want animation for certain events (eg: when getting hit health bar moves, You bleed when hit etc...)
